2. Write a class that extends another class and adds additional methods.

### Day 16: Event Loop
1. Write a program to demonstrate the execution order of `setTimeout`, `Promise.then`, and synchronous code.
2. Create a function that uses `setTimeout` to mimic a stopwatch.

### Day 17: JSON
1. Parse a JSON string into an object and access its properties.
2. Convert a JavaScript object to a JSON string and save it in localStorage.
